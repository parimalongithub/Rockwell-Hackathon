## Project Details

### Client Side
- Developed a **React-based client portal** where users can submit queries to various departments.
- Queries are categorized by department and assigned a priority (High, Medium, Low).
- Integrated **Generative AI (GenAI)** to automatically provide relevant responses or solutions based on the customerâ€™s input.
- Users can view the status of their submitted queries and receive updates when their queries are resolved.

### Admin Side
- Built an **Admin Dashboard** using **Spring Boot and React** to manage department-specific queries.
- Admins can view all submitted queries, categorized by department, and prioritize them based on urgency.
- Clicking on a query retrieves a solution powered by **Large Language Models (LLM)**, streamlining the resolution process.
- Admins have the ability to update the query status (e.g., In Progress, Resolved) and provide feedback to customers.
